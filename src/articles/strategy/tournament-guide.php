	<h3 class="article-header">About Tournament Play</h3>
	<div class="article-section">
		<p>Tournament rules vary between formats, but most of them share the same general &ldquo;show 6, pick 3&rdquo; ruleset. In other words, you enter a tournament with a roster of 6 Pokemon and pick 3 of those Pokemon each time you battle an opponent. Most tournaments feature best-of-three rounds to determine a victor, but be sure to read the rules of your specific tournament before you compete.</p>
		<p>Unlike GO Battle League where you have no knowledge about your opponent&rsquo;s team, tournament play gives you a chance to evaluate your opponent&rsquo;s roster of 6 before you pick 3 to do battle. Different strategies can emerge depending on which play patterns you or your opponent show, and which predictions you make.</p>

	<h3 class="article-header">Tournament Team Building</h3>
	<div class="article-section">
		<p>Making your roster of 6 Pokemon for tournament play involves different considerations than making a team of 3 for GO Battle League. Below are strategies and concepts to think about as you put your squad together.</p>
		<h3>Utilizing Team Cores</h3>
		<p>A core is two Pokemon who cover each other extremely well and have few Pokemon who can beat them both (a &ldquo;core breaker&rdquo;). One example includes Swampert + Skarmory; Swampert beats the Steel types that counter Skarmory, and Skarmory beats the Grass types that counter Swampert. If you haven&rsquo;t yet, check out <a href="https://pvpoke.com/articles/strategy/ultimate-guide-to-team-building/">PolymersUp&rsquo;s article</a> on cores and general team building concepts!</p>
		<p>Choosing a strong, familiar core is a great way to start building your roster. With a full 6 Pokemon at your disposal, you can build to cover your potential core breakers in case you run into them.</p>
		<p>Another solid strategy is to build your team with not one, but two strong cores. This can disguise your potential picks in battle and give you flexibility against the variety of teams you may face. As we&rsquo;ll cover below, cores aren&rsquo;t the only team building concept that benefit from redundancy.</p>
		<h3>Building Your Team with Redundancy</h3>
		<p>A strong tournament team should have balance and variety to answer the meta&rsquo;s most popular threats. However, it&rsquo;s often not enough to have just one answer. <strong>Look to have at least two answers to the top meta Pokemon you expect to encounter.</strong> This will give you more flexibility when you pick your 3 to battle and make you less predictable.</p>
		<p>As an example, let&rsquo;s say your opponent has Galarian Stunfisk on their roster and your Medicham is the only Pokemon that can challenge it. This pressures you to bring Medicham in all of your battles so their Galarian Stunfisk doesn&rsquo;t run through your team. If your roster includes multiple answers, such as an Azumarill or your own Galarian Stunfisk, you&rsquo;ll have more choices when it comes time to battle.</p>
		<p>If you enjoy playing archetypical &ldquo;safe swaps&rdquo; like Sableye or Pelipper, it can benefit to pack multiple safe swap options on your roster. For example, if Sableye is the only safe swap on your roster, your opponent may be able to predict your strategy and bring their Alolan Ninetales to hard counter you. By the same token, if your opponent&rsquo;s roster makes your favorite safe swap no longer safe, having a backup can keep a wrench out of your battle plans.</p>
		<h3>Running Unbalanced Teams</h3>
		<p>It&rsquo;s common to run multiple Pokemon of the same type on a GO Battle League team. We&rsquo;ve talked about redundancy when it comes to tournament teams, but this concept can be taken further with an unbalanced team building strategy.</p>
		<p>An unbalanced roster plays mind games with your opponent. For example, let&rsquo;s say your roster has three Flying types (Skarmory, Altaria, Pelipper). When it comes time to battle, will you bring more than one Flying type? What if you bring none of them, or all three?</p>
		<p>Overloading your roster this way pressures your opponent to predict correctly and baits them into leading certain Pokemon. A roster with three Flying types might draw out Galarian Stunfisk or Walrein leads&mdash;but your Medicham lead is ready to mop them up!</p>
		<p>This strategy takes advantage of traditional balanced team building. Even if your opponent matches their Galarian Stunfisk against one of your Flying types, you have overloaded your team with more than they can cover. This strategy requires good prediction skills so you can know the right time to bait or go all in.</p>
		<h3>Creating Bench Pressure</h3>
		<p>In GO Battle League, polarizing Pokemon like Bastiodon or Charm users can be successful because your opponent can&rsquo;t see them coming, and over the course of dozens or hundreds of battles, your victories might outnumber the occasional hard losses. In tournament play, many of those advantages are lost; your opponent knows which Pokemon are coming, and you usually only have two or three battles to prove yourself.</p>
		<p>Because of this, tournament play tends to favor flexible and dynamic Pokemon over polarizing ones. If you&rsquo;re confident in your prediction skills, polarizing Pokemon can still win the day. These Pokemon also provide a different kind of purpose in tournament formats: bench pressure.</p>
		<p><strong>Bench pressure</strong> is placing a hard counter Pokemon on your roster to deter your opponents from using one or more of their Pokemon in battle. For example, a Bastiodon on your roster could deter your opponent from bringing their Skarmory&mdash;even if you don&rsquo;t intend to bring Bastiodon at all. This kind of pressure opens opportunities for other members of your roster (for example, your Venusaur could have increased play if your opponent is deterred from bringing their Skarmory).</p>
		<p>Bench pressure ebbs and flows during a match. If you don&rsquo;t bring Bastiodon in games 1 or 2, your opponent may call your bluff in game 3. (That is, of course, the perfect time to catch them off guard!) Alternatively, bringing Bastiodon in game 1 can scare away Skarmory for the rest of the round and free up your picks for games 2 and 3.</p>
		<h3>Using Off-Meta Pokemon &amp; Movesets</h3>
		<p>When you want to surprise your opponent and defy expectations, hidden info is a valuable tool in your kit. Most metagames concentrate around 15-20 Pokemon with well defined movesets, but venturing outside of the meta can be an effective way to gain an upper hand and add a personal stamp to your team.</p>
		<p>Off-meta team building choices (aka &ldquo;spice&rdquo;) can provide several advantages. When you have more experience with a unique Pokemon than your opponent, that knowledge gap can give you an edge when it comes to move counts, shielding, switching, and more. An unexpected Pokemon can also make them rethink their battle preparations on the fly, nudging them into unfamiliar team choices or early mistakes.</p>
		<p>Similarly, off-meta move choices can swing games in your favor. Nidoqueen doesn&rsquo;t usually run Stone Edge and Galvantula doesn&rsquo;t normally run Energy Ball, but landing one through two shields can make a decisive difference. Look to protect your secret movesets during non-crucial moments; if you reveal an off-meta move too early or when it won&rsquo;t make a major difference, you&rsquo;re tipping off your opponent for later games!</p>
		<p>As with all team building aspects, take your off-meta choices into careful consideration. &ldquo;Spice&rdquo; for the sake of spice is a recipe for fun, but not always a recipe for success. Focus on the popular meta targets you&rsquo;re looking to beat and find a scrimmage partner to validate that your strategy works in practice. After all, off-meta choices are probably off-meta for a reason, but if you&rsquo;re confident you can make them work, all the more power to you!</p>
		<h3>Using PvPoke&rsquo;s Team Builder</h3>
		<p>The <a href="https://pvpoke.com/team-builder/">Team Builder</a> here on the site is a helpful tool that can guide you to building your tournament roster.</p>
		<p>The Team Builder doesn&rsquo;t require you to enter a full team of 6; try entering 2-3 Pokemon to start and look at the &ldquo;Suggested Alternatives&rdquo; section for inspiration on how to build out your coverage. Choose one suggested alternative, evaluate your team again, and repeat until you have a full roster.</p>
		<p>Once you have your roster drafted, check over the meta and see if you have any glaring weaknesses. Remember, you&rsquo;ll ideally want two answers or checks for each of the meta&rsquo;s most significant Pokemon.</p>
		<p>The scores shown on the Team Builder tool are more of a guideline to identify vulnerabilities, so they&rsquo;re not a strict determination on whether the team will succeed or fail. That part is up to you! The tool is geared toward balanced team building, but unbalanced strategies as mentioned above are just as viable.</p>

	<h3 class="article-header">Pre-Match Evaluation</h3>
	<div class="article-section">
		<p>The table is set, rosters are revealed, and you and your opponent are about to go head to head. Before you pick your 3 Pokemon for battle, what steps should you take to evaluate both teams?</p>
		<p>Tournaments are a high stakes environment and you may only have a few minutes to prepare! This section covers what to look for in the crucial pre-match period so you can pick and predict successfully.</p>
		<p>First, size up how each of your Pokemon matches against your opponent&rsquo;s roster. Then, size up how each of the opponent&rsquo;s Pokemon matches against yours. The key questions you want to answer during this period are:</p>
		<ol>
		    <li>
		        <p><strong>Which of my Pokemon matches up best against my opponent?</strong>&nbsp;This may be a Pokemon that has the most dominant matchups against your opponent or the most neutral play.</p>
		    </li>
		    <li>
		        <p><strong>Which of my opponent&rsquo;s Pokemon matches up best against me?</strong>&nbsp;Similarly, look out for Pokemon you have few dedicated answers for. Which Pokemon could give you the toughest time?</p>
		    </li>
		    <li>
		        <p><strong>How does my opponent stop my best Pokemon?</strong>&nbsp;Identify the key counters you want to avoid if you lead with your safest Pokemon.</p>
		    </li>
		    <li>
		        <p><strong>How do I stop my opponent&rsquo;s best Pokemon?</strong> Consider which counters or coverage moves you may need to lean on to tackle your opponent&rsquo;s safest pick.</p>
		    </li>
		</ol>
		<p>In this example, Player A&rsquo;s Walrein has mostly positive or neutral matchups against Player B&rsquo;s roster. Player B&rsquo;s Scrafty is their hardest answer. Player B may choose to lean on Scrafty, or opt to beat Walrein by committee through neutral matchups. Conversely, Player B&rsquo;s Talonflame matches up extremely well against Player A&rsquo;s roster.</p>
		<p>If this sounds overwhelming, you don&rsquo;t need to memorize exact numbers or scenarios to answer these questions! A general idea of strengths and weaknesses will suffice. With experience, this type of at-a-glance team evaluation will become second nature.</p>

	<a name="pick-strategies"></a>
	<h3 class="article-header">Pick Strategies</h3>
	<div class="article-section">
		<p>You&rsquo;ve sized up both rosters, evaluated the best potential Pokemon, and now it&rsquo;s time to do battle! How do you go about picking 3 Pokemon for your team? There are multiple pick strategies players may try to follow to gain the upper hand or outwit their opponent.</p>
		<p>For Game 1 and subsequent games, you can try one of the following pick strategies based on your evaluation of both rosters:</p>
		<ol>
		    <li>
		        <p><strong>Lead your best Pokemon.</strong> Put your safest Pokemon in the lead, and back it up with two protector Pokemon who can cover its hardest counter.</p>
		    </li>
		    <li>
		        <p><strong>Lead your best Pokemon&rsquo;s protector.</strong> Alternatively, you think your opponent may try to counter your best Pokemon in the lead. Hide it in the back and lead with a Pokemon that counters its counter.</p>
		    </li>
		    <li>
		        <p><strong>Counter your opponent&rsquo;s best Pokemon.</strong> Put your hardest counter to your opponent&rsquo;s safest Pokemon in the lead, or run Pokemon that are at least neutral to it. If you don&rsquo;t line up your hard counter in the lead, swap to try and draw it out.</p>
		    </li>
		    <li>
		        <p><strong>Counter the protector to your opponent&rsquo;s best Pokemon.&nbsp;</strong>You think your opponent is predicting you will lead with your hard counter, so keep it safe in the back and lead with a Pokemon that beats its counters.</p>
		    </li>
		    <li>
		        <p>Use preset teams.&nbsp;You may be comfortable with specific teams of 3 that you&rsquo;ve practiced and put together ahead of the tournament. You can keep these stored in your Battle tab for easy access. Instead of adapting to your opponent&rsquo;s roster, you make them square up against your best, proven lines. While this strategy isn&rsquo;t the most flexible, it can be a good way to lean into your battle experience and avoid line building mistakes during the heat of the moment.</p>
		    </li>
		</ol>
		<p>Pick strategies that involve picking with or against a player&rsquo;s best Pokemon are more relevant when there is a clear best Pokemon. If a Talonflame beats 5/6 Pokemon on your roster, you can be sure Talonflame will be on both player&rsquo;s minds as they pick their 3. Alternatively, these strategies become less important when the best Pokemon is unclear. It&rsquo;s possible that the Pokemon your opponent is worried about most isn&rsquo;t the one you&rsquo;re predicting!</p>
		<p>After the dust has settled from Game 1, different pick strategies come into play for Games 2 and onward. Did you see what you expected? Who won and who lost? Which of your Pokemon is best against their last team, and which of theirs is best against yours? These are all things to take into consideration as you decide a pick strategy for the rest of the round. Pick strategies for later games include:</p>
		<ol>
		    <li>
		        <p><strong>Run the same team.</strong>&nbsp;If your team did really well in Game 1, you may decide to run it back. This makes your opponent adapt to you. This can be particularly effective if your opponent doesn&rsquo;t have a way to break your team core or hard counter you.</p>
		    </li>
		    <li>
		        <p><strong>Run the same team in a different order. </strong>Your team performed well in Game 1, but you predict your opponent will try to hard counter your previous lead. Swap your lead around to try to counter your previous lead&rsquo;s counter.</p>
		    </li>
		    <li>
		        <p><strong>Counter their previous lead.</strong>&nbsp;If you lost Game 1, odds are you may want to make some team changes. If your opponent runs the same team again, you can try to catch them by countering their previous lead. Alternatively, you can try to bring Pokemon that go neutral against your opponent&rsquo;s previous team to give you more play.</p>
		    </li>
		    <li>
		        <p><strong>Use your last winning team.</strong>&nbsp;If you won Game 1 but lost Game 2, you may want to go back to the line that got you your first victory. On the flip side, if you lost Game 1 and won Game 2, keep in mind how your opponent won the first game as you prepare for Game 3.</p>
		    </li>
		    <li>
		        <p><strong>Mix it up.</strong> If you&rsquo;ve brought the same 3 Pokemon in the first few battles, it may be time to bring a completely different lineup in Game 3. This can be effective if you have a bench pressure Pokemon you haven&rsquo;t shown in Games 1 or 2, and your opponent gets too comfortable in Game 3.</p>
		    </li>
		</ol>
		<p>These are just some of the things to think about as you battle through your tournament, and hopefully they help you prepare for your competition!</p>

	<a name="post-match"></a>
	<h3 class="article-header">Post-Match Evaluation</h3>
	<div class="article-section">
		<p>After your battles, it&rsquo;s time to thank your opponent for the match and reflect on your games. Were your predictions correct or off? Were there any decisions that decided a particular battle, and what would you choose to do differently?</p>
		<p>If they&rsquo;re willing to help, your opponent is one of the most valuable resources you can ask! See if you can learn what they saw from your team, what they predicted, and why they made certain decisions during your battles. Their insight can provide valuable info you can apply to future opponents.</p>
		<p>Take a close look at the Pokemon that worked best for you, or Pokemon that struggled. If you had a particular team of 3 that worked really well, keep it in mind for your next battles. When the next round begins, compare your new opponent&rsquo;s roster to the previous one and see if you&rsquo;ll encounter similar opportunities or challenges.</p>
