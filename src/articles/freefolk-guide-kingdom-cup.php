	<p dir="ltr">Tempest has ended, and the time has come to clash in the Kingdom Cup! In this battle of Ice, Fire, Dragon, and Steel, two Pokemon are poised to lead the charge: Bastiodon and Lucario. The catch? These Pokemon aren&rsquo;t all that easy catch! Bastiodon needs to be powered up to near level 40, and Riolu only hatches from 7k and 10k eggs (or so I&rsquo;m told).</p>
  	<p dir="ltr"><strong>Uncertain of your chances without Bastiodon and Lucario?</strong> Never fear! This guide will help you put together a competitive team to take on that steely throne. With a mix of cost-effective Pokemon and ones from previous cups, this article should help you get a Kingdom Cup crew going in no time! </p>

	  <p dir="ltr">Before we build our team, we have to know which Pokemon we need to beat. This list may change over time as the Kingdom Cup develops, and may differ from what you might see in your local group, but should be a good general guide preparing for the tournament.	  </p>

	  <p dir="ltr">Bastiodon, Altaria, Lucario, and Lapras should be the biggest ones on your radar. You&rsquo;ll see scorecards for each Pokemon below so you can quickly see their matchups against the above.</p>

  <h3 class="article-header">Song of Ice</h3>
	<div class="article-section">
	  <p dir="ltr">Ice Pokemon will struggle in this tournament with their weaknesses to Rock, Fire, Fighting, and Steel. However, they have a few key targets: Altaria and Flygon are both doubly weak to Ice, and Dragonair also has an exploitable Ice weakness. The best Ice Pokemon here will be ones with strong secondary moves to hit the rest of the cup hard, and dual typing that mitigates some of their weaknesses. They&rsquo;re vulnerable to the core of this cup, so if you use them, maneuver them carefully to ensure they find their best matchups.</p>

	  <p dir="ltr">This Tempest star would be at the center of the Kingdom Cup if Lucario and Bastiodon didn&rsquo;t snatch the spotlight. Its weaknesses are offset by incredible bulk and a great moveset. Here you&rsquo;ll want Water attacks to hit Fire, Rock, and Ground types with rapid damage. The legacy move Ice Beam is also ideal; legacy Dragon Pulse can hit a ton of stuff hard including other Lapras, and if all else fails, Blizzard works with some shield baiting. Short on Stardust? Lapras can still do well with just Water Gun + Surf. (You&rsquo;ll struggle against Altaria and Dragonair, but if you delay your Surf attacks, you can still give them a fright.)	  </p>
	  <p dir="ltr">An Ice Lapras can still be useful here, but it&rsquo;ll lose harder to both Lucario and Bastiodon. It gears Lapras toward an anti-Dragon role, so surround it with a team that can handle the Fire and Steel types it can't if it uses Ice moves.</p>
	  <p dir="ltr">Lapras is an extremely well-rounded Pokemon that only fears a few, namely Lucario, Kingdra, and other Lapras (especially with Dragon Pulse). It can fit anywhere on your team, and even on your bench it&rsquo;s a Pokemon your opponent must work around. If Lucario proves to be a popular lead, it may be best to keep Lapras in the back. Then it&rsquo;ll give you a safe switch option, and you can roll over the enemy team once you&rsquo;ve eliminated their Lucario.</p>

	  <p dir="ltr">Froslass is eligible for her third dance in a row, so if you have one from Twilight or Tempest, don&rsquo;t be afraid to bring her to the (shadow) ball. She&rsquo;s up to her usual high-energy, high-damage antics in Kingdom Cup, too. Her Ghost typing gives her a key resistance to Fighting-type moves, which lets her counter Blaziken and check Lucario if she has an energy lead (but watch out for Shadow Ball). She&rsquo;s a fierce pick against the dragons that roam the land. Shadow Ball is essential for being virtually unresisted in this cup. It can hit almost any target for high damage or force a shield.	  </p>
	  <p dir="ltr">Froslass needs a keen eye for the exit, because big targets like Bastiodon and Lapras who resist her Ice attacks will expose just how frail she is. Steelix is also a threat with its super effective Crunch. Pair her with Pokemon who can generate shield pressure to create the closing scenarios she wants, and who cover her weaknesses.	  </p>
	  <p dir="ltr">How should Froslass be played? She&rsquo;s at her A-game as a powerful closer. Keep her at a safe distance so you can sweep her problem matchups out of the way before she does her thing. She&rsquo;s frail, so take extra care if you decide to switch her in.</p>
	  <h3 dir="ltr">Alolan Ninetales</h3>
	  <p dir="ltr"><strong>Moveset:</strong> Powder Snow + Ice Beam/Psyshock<br>
	    <strong>Sources: </strong>7k Eggs<br>

	  <p dir="ltr">Alolan Ninetales&rsquo; claim to fame is a double Dragon resistance that makes it the hardest Altaria counter around.It can make do against the dragons without Psyshock, but Psyshock gives it extra flexibility to maneuver around shields or deal a finishing blow. Compared to Froslass, it has more bulk and flexibility.</p>
	  <p dir="ltr">Our Alolan Fairy isn&rsquo;t a failure outside its Dragon matchups, either. It has generally positive matchups against Steelix and Blaziken, resisting their Fighting, Dragon, and Dark moves. However, it&rsquo;s very vulnerable to Lucario, Bastiodon, and Lapras. It&rsquo;s a risky pick. You won&rsquo;t want to lead with this one (unless you&rsquo;re super duper sure about your opponent&rsquo;s picks). It&rsquo;s also not a Pokemon you&rsquo;ll want to switch to offensively since your opponent will be bound to have something that can beat it hard. Instead, keep it in back as a revenge killer, or try and lure out the Dragons so you can make a defensive switch. It pairs extremely well with Blaziken, who can hurt the big three that Ninetales loses to, and can potentially draw out Altaria, Dragonair, or Flygon for easy pickings.</p>
	  <h3 dir="ltr">Abomasnow</h3>
	  <p dir="ltr"><strong>Moveset: </strong>Razor Leaf + Outrage/Blizzard<br>
	    <strong>Sources:</strong> Wild, 5k Eggs<br>
	    <strong>Extra Move Cost: </strong>50k Stardust<br>
      <strong>Pair With:</strong> Melmetal, Steelix, Alolan Marowak, Altaria, a good luck charm </p>

	  <p dir="ltr">Lapras fears very few things, but this boreal behemoth is one of them. Razor Leaf tears through Lapras and other Pokemon like Flygon and Kingdra. Its energy gain is glacially slow, though, so you&rsquo;ll want a hard-hitting Outrage for the next thing that comes in (like Altaria). Blizzard is nice as an option, but Abomasnow will rarely get to use it.	  </p>
	  <p dir="ltr">Abomasnow is a highly risky pick this time because there are more punches and fires being thrown around. Any matchup it isn&rsquo;t meant for, it&rsquo;s going to lose hard and give your opponent the ability to build up a dangerous energy lead. It&rsquo;s an option if you&rsquo;re lacking answers to Lapras, but take extra care using it on your roster.</p>

	<p dir="ltr">A few Fire-type Pokemon stand out above the fray, and some not even for their fiery abilities.

    <p dir="ltr">Charizard saw its first action in Tempest Cup, but had to tread lightly with all the zappy Lanturns around. In the Kingdom Cup, its main targets are significantly less bulky, and Dragon Claw gets to thrive in a target-rich environment. Charizard&rsquo;s main job is beating Lucario, and beating it hard. It can and should do so with Fast Moves alone so you&rsquo;ll have a terrifying Blast Burn ready for whatever comes out next. Like Blaziken, Charizard needs shields to work, so watch out for Shadow Balls from any opposing Lucario. </p>
    <p dir="ltr">Blast Burn Charizard is like bringing a fighter jet to a sword fight. It will demand a shield or take a huge chunk of HP from almost anything it hits. Charizard with Dragon Claw alone can still work, but Blast Burn applies tremendous pressure after it&rsquo;s swooped in on Lucario. With successful shield baiting, Charizard can even take on Lapras in a pinch. If you can&rsquo;t get your hands on a Blast Burn Charizard, consider another Lucario counter that has broader utility. </p>
  <p dir="ltr">Charizard can pressure shields as a lead, but its struggles against likely opponents such as Altaria and Lapras may make it better as a defensive pivot. You can try a Bastiodon or Lapras lead to draw out the opponent&rsquo;s Lucario. Charizard gets blown out of the sky by Bastiodon, so make sure to pack a Bastiodon counter and avoid that matchup at all costs.</p>

	<p dir="ltr">What if I told you there was a Pokemon capable of taking on Lucario, Bastiodon, and sometimes even Lapras? What if I told you it was a chicken?	</p>
	<p dir="ltr">Blaziken has the distinction of being the only Pokemon besides Lucario who gets to bring Counter to the fight. What does that mean? Extremely high damage output against the top players of the cup. Blaziken is similar to Razor Leaf Abomasnow in the Tempest Cup - it beats its targets through its Fast Move alone, so its longer Charged Moves are for the next Pokemon that switches in. Brave Bird is its quickest option and hits everything that Focus Blast doesn&rsquo;t. At worst, you&rsquo;ll force your opponent to burn a shield. And if you manage to maneuver a fully charged Blaziken into a closing situation, it&rsquo;s nigh unbeatable.	</p>
	<p dir="ltr">If you&rsquo;re the only person in the world who has a Stone Edge Blaziken under 1500 CP, don&rsquo;t you dare use anything else.	</p>
	<p dir="ltr">As you can from the scorecard above, Blaziken needs shields to be effective, so make sure to save one for your chicken champion. Blaziken is countered hard by this cup&rsquo;s squadron of fliers, including Altaria, Charizard, and Skarmory, so look to avoid being locked into those matchups. It also shouldn&rsquo;t be your sole answer to Bastiodon, Lucario, and Lapras; it can handle any one of them well, but two will be too much for our feathered friend to handle. It&rsquo;s frail, too, so even switching into positive matchups will be dangerous for it.  </p>
	<p>A good trick to know for Blaziken: it may perform better when not using Charged Move at all. If you're going for the win and your opponent has shields, Blaziken doesn't usually have the speed or stamina to break them <i>and</i> deal the final blow. Especially against targets who are weak to Counter, just keep Countering away and race for that finish line!</p>

	<p dir="ltr">Alolan Marowak is one of the few bulky Fire types, and like Froslass, its Ghost typing gives it valuable resistance to Lucario and Blaziken&rsquo;s lethal Fighting moves. Its Ghost moves are virtually unresisted, and Bone Club gives it a quick coverage option against Lucario, Bastiodon, and Blaziken. Want to turn Alolan Marowak into a true Lucario counter? Rock Smash gets the job done and makes its Bastiodon matchup more even, but your broader matchups will be worse by hindering your ability to charge Shadow Ball.	</p>
	<p dir="ltr">With a combination of power and survivability, Marowak can fit in a lead or closing role. Marowak is also wickedly good with a shield advantage. Thanks to its bulk and good neutral damage, Marowak has many decent matchups across the board, especially against other Fire types. The main things that give it trouble are Bastiodon, Steelix, Flygon, and Lapras, so watch out for those as you twirl your fiery club to glory!</p>

	<p dir="ltr">Typhlosion shares stats with Charizard, along with the all-powerful move Blast Burn, but that&rsquo;s where the similarities end. For starters, Typhlosion has Shadow Claw for extremely high energy gain. This plus Blast Burn makes for a terrifying combination. Typhlosion also has Solar Beam, which will annihilate Lapras and Flygon if unblocked. Typhlosion is best as a closer, where its knockout power helps it skirt around the fact that it has no bulk. It&rsquo;s okay, Typhlosion, not everyone does. That&rsquo;s what shields are for, and Typhlosion does tremendously with a shield advantage.	</p>
	<p dir="ltr">With a Blast Burn that&rsquo;s a full second faster than Charizard&rsquo;s, Typhlosion is better equipped to take on Steel-type Pokemon like Steelix, Skarmory, and Bronzong. Without wings like Charizard&rsquo;s, Typhlosion fully resists Ice, isn&rsquo;t weak to Melmetal&rsquo;s Electric attacks, and doesn&rsquo;t get outright annihilated by Bastiodon - well, as much.  </p>
  <p dir="ltr">Now comes the part where Typhlosion plugs its ears. Unfortunately, the lack of wings is also a hindrance. Typhlosion doesn&rsquo;t resist crucial Fighting attacks like Charizard does, and it takes the full force of Ground-type attacks. These become glaring when your opponent still has shields to draw Typhlosion into extended fights. Keep Typhlosion close to your chest and do your best to put in a place where it can succeed.</p>

	<h3 class="article-header">There Be Dragons</h3>
	<div class="article-section">
		<p dir="ltr">Dragons are renowned for their offensive prowess and resistances to common types. Most of them come spewing Dragon Breath, one of the strongest Fast Moves in the game, and the top ones here have great Charged Moves as well. If you want to succeed in the Kingdom Cup, add one of these to your hoard.</p>

		</div>
		
		
		<p dir="ltr">Everywhere Altaria is allowed, it strives to be the center of attention. Even a double-Ice weakness can&rsquo;t slow it down. It has bulk, great offensive typing, and excellent moves to boot. It&rsquo;s not all Cloud Nine for this fluffy fellow, though, because Bastiodon, Steelix, Melmetal, and other Steel types are here in force to knock it down. It even falls to Lucario if it doesn&rsquo;t shield carefully. Still, Altaria is a powerhouse and can crush teams that fail to answer it.		</p>
		<p dir="ltr">Dragon Breath + Sky Attack is your bread and butter. Dragon Pulse isn&rsquo;t necessary here, but gives you a late-game hammer against other dragons swapping in and can be the decisive blow in mirror matches against other Altaria.		</p>
		<p dir="ltr">Altaria is a popular lead choice, but its struggles against Bastiodon and Lapras may push it deeper into the lineup this time around. Its best matchups are against the frail Fire types it resists, like Blaziken and Charizard, and it can bring any other dragon down with it. Just about everything with Steel typing will give it trouble though, especially Bastiodon, so look out for those as you consider Altaria for your lineup. On the other side, Altaria is a key Pokemon you&rsquo;ll want to be able to challenge sans Bastiodon.</p>

		<p dir="ltr">Dragonite should be left in its lair for the Kingdom Cup, but its graceful pre-evolution is here to make some waves! Dragonair gets to pair Dragon Breath with its quick Aqua Tail to rain blows on the opponent. Dragonair especially appreciates the Water attack for hitting Steel types like Bastiodon who can put up a wall against other dragons.</p>
		<p>Dragon Pulse is a very expensive addition that might not be worth the cost. However, it does add potency to Dragonair&rsquo;s shield breaking power. Without the threat of Dragon Pulse, Pokemon like Altaria and Lapras have no reason to throw up their shields. (Worst comes to worst, you can bluff having Dragon Pulse by delaying your Aqua Tail.) Wrap is an interesting alternative that gives you a faster, more reliable neutral damage option against targets who resist Aqua Tail. It also removes shield baiting from the equation for these fights, so choose Wrap if you want to be less dependent on tricking your opponent to come out ahead.</p>
		<p>Did I just convince myself to run Wrap?</p>
		<p dir="ltr">Dragonair rarely goes down without a fight. However, its frailness does spell a few problems. In particular, it may struggle to switch in and beat the things you expect it to. It has nightmares about Steel-type Pokemon like Lucario, Steelix, and Bronzong, who resist Dragon Breath and hit hard back.</p>
	  <h3 dir="ltr">Flygon</h3>
	  <p dir="ltr"><strong>Moveset: </strong>Mud Shot + Dragon Claw/Earthquake<br>
	    <strong>Sources: </strong>Wild, 10k Eggs<br>
	    <strong>Extra Move Cost: </strong>75k Stardust<br>
      <strong>Pair With: </strong>Melmetal, Bronzong, Lairon, Froslass </p>
		<p dir="ltr">Flygon separates itself from its kin with a wicked fast moveset and Ground attacks that target the Kingdom Cup&rsquo;s biggest (and stompiest) players. This little guy can drag Bastiodon, Melmetal, and Steelix beneath the dunes. Powered by Mud Shot&rsquo;s high energy gain, Dragon Claw makes for great shield breaking and decent neutral damage, while Earthquake delivers the killing blow. Stone Edge/Earthquake is a possible closing set, but you&rsquo;ll likely want Flygon&rsquo;s talents early and often.		</p>
		<p dir="ltr">If you&rsquo;re going to pay a pretty penny for any Pokemon&rsquo;s second Charged Move, Flygon is a major candidate. The combination of Dragon Claw and Earthquake makes for valuable speed and power. Flygon is at its best when it can bait shields with Dragon Claw, and then follow up with the hard-hitting Earthquake.		</p>
		<p dir="ltr">How should you play Flygon? It's safe as a defensive switch so it can avoid its more troublesome matchups, like Altaria, Charizard, and Lapras. You may be tempted to lead with it for its high energy, but Flygon doesn't have the bulk to power through neutral matchups like other potential leads like Altaria, Lapras, and Marowak can. Be aware that Mud Shot has very low damage and Flygon is highly dependent on its Charged Moves for damage output, so it will struggle to knock out weakened opponents quickly or farm energy from positive matchups.</p>
	  <h3 dir="ltr">Kingdra</h3>
	  <p dir="ltr"><strong>Moveset: </strong>Dragon Breath + Outrage/Hydro Pump<br>
	    <strong>Sources: </strong>Wild, 2k Eggs<br>
	    <strong>Extra Move Cost: </strong>75k Stardust<br>
      <strong>Pair With: </strong>Steelix, Charizard, Lapras </p>
		<p dir="ltr">Kingdra boasts double Fire resistance and neutral damage to Ice thanks to its unique typing. Like the other dragons, it&rsquo;s well equipped to take on the cup&rsquo;s Fire types. Unlike them, it can check Lapras. Waterfall is an option that turns Kingdra&rsquo;s Fire-type matchups into resounding victories and greatly improves its chances against Steelix, Lucario, and Bastiodon. However, it flips Kingdra&rsquo;s Dragon matchups into hard losses and allows Altaria, Dragonair, and other Kingdra to build up energy uncontested.		</p>
		<p dir="ltr">Kingdra&rsquo;s slower attacks gear it for more of a closer role, though it fits somewhere awkwardly in the middle. Kingdra&rsquo;s best case scenario is mopping up the opponent&rsquo;s second-to-last Pokemon so it can enter the final fight with an energy lead. Some clever switching early game can also set up Kingdra in a similar scenario with energy already built. Hydro Pump is essential for closing out against Steel types like Bastiodon or Steelix, who resist its Dragon attacks.</p>
	  <h3 dir="ltr">Shelgon</h3>
	  <p dir="ltr"><strong>Moveset: </strong>Dragon Breath + Twister/Flamethrower<br>
	    <strong>Sources: </strong>Wild, 10k Eggs, Tier 1 Raids<br>
	    <strong>Extra Move Cost: </strong>75k Stardust<br>
      <strong>Pair With: </strong>Steelix, Bronzong, Blaziken </p>
		<p dir="ltr">Where Dragonair gets a fancy Water move, Shelgon brings the heat! It deals reliable damage with Dragon Breath, and then Flamethrower can threaten the Steel types that shut other dragons down. It&rsquo;s a lofty 75k Stardust, though, so if you have to run a single move on Shelgon, I would recommend Twister. It feels odd recommending a move that&rsquo;s so weak on paper, but Shelgon doesn&rsquo;t have bulk like Altaria does to win extended fights, and that 45-energy option gives it a knockout punch against Flygon, Kingdra, and Dragonair.	  </p>
	  <p dir="ltr">If you can maneuver Shelgon into a position with an energy advantage, Dragon Pulse could be worth considering over Twister in closing scenarios; Shelgon struggles to reach Dragon Pulse most times, so if you can accomplish this consistently, Dragon Pulse may be right for you.	</p>

	<a name="steel"></a>
	<h3 class="article-header">Steel Yourself</h3>
	<div class="article-section">
		<p dir="ltr">Where there are dragons, there are dragon slayers. An army of Steel-type Pokemon is here to brandish their swords and shields. There&rsquo;s a wide variety of options below and each of them has advantages and disadvantages you&rsquo;ll want to consider as you build your team.</p>
	  <h3 dir="ltr">Steelix</h3>
	  <p dir="ltr">Moveset: Dragon Tail + Crunch/Earthquake<br>
		Sources: Wild, Field Research (Make 3 Great Throws in a row)<br>
		Extra Move Cost: 75k Stardust<br>
	  Pair With: Altaria, Charizard, Lapras, Dragonair, Bronzong </p>
		<p dir="ltr">This grizzled veteran of the Boulder and Tempest Cups is back and ready for more anti-air action. Dragon Tail is even more valuable here, hitting the numerous Dragon options for super effective damage while Steelix resists Dragon Breath in return. Crunch is used for baiting shields and neutral damage against the fliers who resist Earthquake. Earthquake, meanwhile, punishes Steel types like Bastiodon who fail to block it. Steelix&rsquo;s second move has a steep cost, though, so if you have to run only one move, consider whether you want your Steelix to be anti-Dragon or anti-Steel.	</p>
		<p dir="ltr">A key component of playing Steelix is playing mind games with Crunch and Earthquake. Build up enough energy for Earthquake, and then make your opponent guess whether you&rsquo;re actually using Earthquake or baiting their shields with a low-energy Crunch. Mix this up as your opponent gains experience against you; if you bait shields with Crunch in the first round, try hitting them with Earthquake in the second and see if they&rsquo;ll let it through unblocked.	</p>
		<p dir="ltr">Steelix has previously enjoyed being a relatively safe choice and switch given its huge number of resistances, solid defenses, and few counters. It has a lot more to be wary of in the Kingdom Cup, though. Where Lapras preferred Ice-type attacks in Tempest, it&rsquo;ll likely be packing Water Gun here. And that&rsquo;s to say nothing of the Fighting-type Pokemon that Steelix has to contend with! This could make Steelix&rsquo;s ability to lead more tenuous. Again, depending on which leads prove popular, Steelix may be better kept in reserve - especially if it&rsquo;s your only answer to the Dragons.</p>
	  <h3 dir="ltr">Skarmory</h3>
	  <p dir="ltr">Moveset: Air Slash + Sky Attack/Flash Cannon<br>
		Sources: Wild<br>
		Extra Move Cost: 75k Stardust<br>
	  Pair With: Steelix, Lapras, Flygon, Blaziken </p>
		<p dir="ltr">And you thought you had seen the last of this flying fortress. There&rsquo;s lot more to blast it out of the sky this time around, so can&rsquo;t soar about unchecked. It also has to compete with Charizard and Altaria, who bring more strengths to the table. Don&rsquo;t count Skarmory out just yet, though. It&rsquo;s still determined to prove itself in the Kingdom Cup.	</p>
		<p dir="ltr">Skarmory&rsquo;s combination of Flying and Steel typing give it favorable matchups against Blaziken and the dragons. Where Altaria has to watch out for incoming Dragon-type attacks, Skarmory can shrug off Dragon Breath and Dragon Claw.	</p>
		<p dir="ltr">In the Tempest Cup, Skarmory was powerful for its ability to &ldquo;farm&rdquo; energy from ubiquitous opponents like Tropius and Abomasnow, which it could take down with Fast Moves alone. This almost always spelled victory for the team that could accomplish this, because the subsequent Sky Attacks would devastate whatever switched in next. In the Kingdom Cup, Skarmory can safely farm energy against Blaziken, and against Flygon, Dragonair, and Kingdra if they&rsquo;re weakened. However, this strategy likely won&rsquo;t be as formidable in Kingdom as it was in Tempest, since Kingdom is crawling with things that eat Sky Attacks for breakfast. Bastiodon and Melmetal are specially equipped to stop a supercharged Skarmory in its tracks, so watch out for those in the opposing lineup.</p>
	  <h3 dir="ltr">Melmetal</h3>
	  <p dir="ltr">Moveset: Thundershock + Rock Slide/Flash Cannon or Thunderbolt<br>
		Sources: Mystery Box (obtained from Pokemon Let&rsquo;s Go Eevee and Pokemon Let&rsquo;s Go Pikachu)<br>
		Extra Move Cost: 100k Stardust<br>
	  Pair With: Charizard, Altaria, Blaziken, Alolan Marowak </p>
		<p dir="ltr">If you have a Melmetal from Boulder Cup, it could be worth bringing back for Kingdom. It&rsquo;s one of the few Pokemon that can safely switch into Altaria, and puts up a hard fight against most of the other dragons. With Thundershock&rsquo;s fast energy gain, Melmetal is also highly flexible. Rock Slide is the vital move for beating Altaria and Charizard. Flash Cannon provides a hard-hitting closing move that specifically targets Bastiodon, while Thunderbolt gives it a neutral damage option against other Steel types like Bronzong and opposing Melmetal.	</p>
		<p dir="ltr">Melmetal is the closest thing to a Bastiodon replacement because it can check Altaria, Skarmory, and Charizard. That&rsquo;s no easy task! Similar to Bastiodon, it crumples to Fighting- and Ground-type moves. Ground especially threatens Melmetal because it resists Melmetal&rsquo;s main attacks. If you&rsquo;re looking at Melmetal and haven&rsquo;t invested in one previously, consider it carefully since the investment is such a significant one! It may be more efficient to answer Altaria and Charizard with separate Pokemon that bring additional utility, like Steelix, Lapras, or Froslass.</p>
	  <h3 dir="ltr">Empoleon</h3>
	  <p dir="ltr">Moveset: Waterfall + Hydro Pump/Blizzard<br>
		Sources: Wild<br>
		Extra Move Cost: 10k Stardust<br>
	  Pair With: Altaria, Melmetal, Alolan Ninetales </p>
		<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;March of the Penguins&rdquo; would certainly be more terrifying if the penguins involved were 5&rsquo;7&rdquo; and made of steel. Empoleon waddles to war with the hard-hitting move Waterfall. It acts as an avian Abomasnow, pummeling Fire and other Steel-type targets with its Fast Move alone. When it enters the next matchup, it has powerful closing moves like Hydro Pump and Blizzard ready to go.	</p>
		<p dir="ltr">Empoleon claims victories over important Pokemon like Bastiodon, Charizard, and Steelix. The key to these fights to use Waterfall, and Waterfall only if shields are still in play. Waterfall can&rsquo;t be blocked, and your Charged Moves are better saved for the next Pokemon to come in.	</p>
		<p dir="ltr">Anything that resists Waterfall is a problem for Empoleon, which means it has tough matchups against Lapras and all of the Dragon-type Pokemon. It&rsquo;s best used as a defensive switch or to mop up weakened targets so it can go into closing situations with an energy lead. Empoleon is yet another Pokemon that really needs shields to thrive; its Steel typing helps hide its meager bulk.</p>
	  <h3 dir="ltr">Bronzong</h3>
	  <p dir="ltr">Moveset: Confusion + Heavy Slam/Flash Cannon<br>
		Sources: Wild, 5k eggs<br>
		Extra Move Cost: 50k Stardust<br>
	  Pair With: Lapras, Flygon, Steelix, Typhlosion </p>
		<p dir="ltr">The move Confusion terrorized the Twilight Cup, and Bronzong is here for a fashionably late encore. It wraps a number of interesting matchups in a steely package. Bronzong&rsquo;s Psychic typing means it doesn&rsquo;t take super effective damage from Fighting-type attacks that pummel the other Steel Pokemon. Confusion lays the hurt on Blaziken in particular, while Bronzong takes on on all the dragons sans Flygon thanks to its Steel typing. Heavy Slam is the preferred move for most situations while Flash Cannon gives it decent closing power.	</p>
		<p dir="ltr">Another big plus in favor of Bronzong is it has favorable or close matchups against both Lapras and Lucario. However, it struggles most against other Steel types who resist its attacks. Confusion and lack of coverage options make Bronzong slow and potentially predictable. You know what you&rsquo;re going to get when you use it or face it, so keep your matchups in mind!</p>
	  <h3 dir="ltr">Lairon</h3>
	  <p dir="ltr">Moveset: Metal Claw + Rock Slide/Body Slam<br>
		Sources: Wild, 2k Eggs<br>
		Extra Move Cost: 10k Stardust<br>
	  Pair With: Altaria, Charizard, Flygon, Blaziken </p>
		<p dir="ltr">We&rsquo;re reaching the bottom entries of the Bastiodon look-alike contest, and Lairon can get the job done with some grit and determination. Lairon checks the boxes for most things a Bastiodon replacement should do (beat the fliers and dragons). However, it can&rsquo;t switch in as freely as other options can, like Melmetal.  </p>
	  <p dir="ltr">While Lairon wins where it should, it loses some big matchups very, very badly. Lucario, Lapras, and Steelix all pound it back into the Pokeball from whence it came, and the runner up of the Bastiodon look-alike contest, Bastiodon itself, gives it a very hard time (Ditto is banned from the arena). Lairon is an affordable option but you might be better off investing in a well-rounded alternative.</p>
