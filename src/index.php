	<h3>What's New</h3>

	<h4>v1.12.21 (January 8, 2020)</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Pokemon with moves that debuff their own Attack like Psycho Boost and Superpower will now bait shields with higher energy, non-debuffing moves.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Pokemon will only bait with moves that are within 10 energy of the self debuffing move, and when the shield bait toggle is enabled.</li>
			<li>The Consistency score formula has been adjusted to account for these movesets.</li>
			<li>This greatly improves matches for Pokemon like Defense Deoxys and Melmetal. Because this behavior provides less consistency, the effect on the overall rankings isn't as drastic as the matchup changes may suggest.</li>

		</ul>
